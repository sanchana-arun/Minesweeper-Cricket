# Minesweeper-Cricket
Minesweeper Cricket is a blend of classic Minesweeper and cricket-themed fun. It is a web-based game where you click on grid blocks to score points. The objective is to avoid hidden "fielder" blocks while aiming to find "bonus" blocks for extra points. The game ends if you click on a fielder, and you win when all non-fielder blocks are revealed.

Objective: The goal of Minesweeper Cricket is to score as many runs as possible by clicking on the blocks that represent a cricket field. But beware! There are fielders lurking, and some blocks contain bonus runs.

Getting Started:

Run the "index.html" file in the game folder.
You'll be greeted with the game's title, "Minesweeper Cricket," and a "Start Game" button.

Starting the Game: Click the "Start Game" button to begin your cricket adventure.

A cricket field will appear with a grid of blocks. Your current score is displayed at the top.

Gameplay: Your mission is to click on the blocks to score runs. Each block represents a potential run on the cricket field.

Left-click on a block to reveal it. Here's what can happen when you reveal a block:
If it's a regular block (not a fielder or bonus), you'll score one run, and the block will turn green.
If it's a fielder, you'll be caught out! The block will turn red, and your game ends.
If it's a bonus block, you'll hit a boundary! You'll score six runs, and the block will turn purple.

Scoring: Your total score is displayed at the top under "Score" Strive to maximize your score by finding bonus blocks while avoiding fielders.

Game Over: The game continues until you reveal all the blocks or until you hit a fielder.

If you reveal all blocks without hitting any fielders, you win the game!
If you hit a fielder, a "Game Over" popup will appear, asking if you want to continue playing.
Clicking "Yes" in the popup will restart the game, allowing you to give it another shot.
Clicking "No" will take you back to the home page, where you can restart the game or explore other options.

When you play the game and it's game over (either you win or lose), a "Game Over" popup will appear, and you'll be asked if you want to continue playing. If you click "Yes" to continue, the game will reset with a new grid. When you hit "No", you will be redirected to a window that's when the confetti comes into play! The screen will be showered with colorful confetti. It's like a virtual party to cheer you on for another round of Minesweeper Cricket!
