# Minesweeper-Cricket
Minesweeper Cricket is a blend of classic Minesweeper and cricket-themed fun. It is a web-based game where you click on grid blocks to score points. The objective is to avoid hidden "fielder" blocks while aiming to find "bonus" blocks for extra points. The game ends if you click on a fielder, and you win when all non-fielder blocks are revealed.
